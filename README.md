# Contactless Delivery

In the times of COVID-19, it is important to avoid transmission as much as possible, and as such many delivery and postal companies have switched to a contactless delivery system. However this is not yet completely widespread, and many delivery persons are still uncertain about the procedure.

In the interest of raising awareness of the contactless delivery procedure, we provide an easy to understand, international, printer friendly sign to be displayed at the door.

## How to use it
Simply print out the image that matches your language, and hang it on your door. The images are designed to be printer friendly, and should print well on virtually any printer, spending minimal ink/toner.

Is your language not listed? See the contributing section below.

## Provided languages
We currently provide the following languages (formats):
* English GB (A4)
* English US (US letter)
* Dutch (A4)
* Portuguese (A4)
* Russian (A4)
